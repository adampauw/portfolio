#### Description:
I have created a website to give developers some real world experience before they begin their first jobs. By completing the tasks on my website 
new developers will be able to display real projects on their CV's as well as collaboration with Designers both of wich are saught after skills and can make
the difference when applying for jobs.

I thought of this idea because I beleive there is a gap between finishing bootcamps and getting your first job and with this I hope to give developers the confidence to close this gap and not feel the imposter syndrome that I felt when I began my Career. I tried to mimic the real workplace as much as possible by providing designs and descpriptions much like what you would find in a Jira ticket at work. In the future I will provide a way to share feedback as well

Users will be able to visit the site and see real projects curated from actual designs much like they would see in their prospective careers. When they decided on a project to begin they will get a breif summary on what needs to be done to complete this task as well as the designs and some tips on how to succeed.

I used ReactJS to build my project as I am familiar with it and I included some extra technologies wich might have been a tad overkill but it was fun to learn, for example nearly all styled are done using @emotionJS's stylized components which really help to clean up the code as well as enable props or state to control the styles being painted on the screen. 

There are currently two main pages on the site. the main page wich welcomes the users into what they can expect to learn and gain from using my site then a second page with all the currently available tasks. The entire site is responsive all the way down to small mobile screens. in the tasks page I created a Modal component which also adapts to mobile versions. click off the side of the modal will close it as well as pressing esc. The modal was my favourite part to create as I have never actually built one from scratch before so finally getting it to work felt great

Thank you for listing to my idea and I hope you find it as interesting as I do. 
I would also like to thank you for an amazing course, I learned many things I never knew before and for the things I did know it expanded my understanding of them greatly
